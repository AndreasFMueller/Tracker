README for the tracker project
------------------------------

The tracker is a small stepper motor controller used to drive a a
sky tracker.

The tracker works in two speed modes. While tracking, it advances
the screw shaft in such a way as to travel for 1 degree every four
minutes, in rewind mode it moves as fast as the stepper motor allows,
i.e. at about 400 steps per second.

The pitch of the screw is 0.7mm per turn. For a radius of 250mm,
we have to rotate the screw at a speed of 0.0259721614 rotations
per second. NMEA-17 motors typically have 200 steps per revolution,
thus the driver must step the motor at 5.1944 steps per seccond.

The stepper drivers are configured for 16th step microstepping,
which means that in slow speed, pulses at 83.1Hz are needed, and
in fast speed, we attempt to move the motor at 400 steps per second,
i.e.  with a frequence of 6.4kHz.
