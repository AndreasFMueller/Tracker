README for the tracker project
------------------------------

The tracker is a small stepper motor controller used to drive a a
sky tracker.

The tracker works in two speed modes. While tracking, it advances
the screw shaft in such a way as to travel for 1 degree every four
minutes, in rewind mode it moves as fast as the stepper motor allows,
i.e. at about 400 steps per second.

The pitch of the screw is 0.7mm per turn. For a radius of 250mm,
we have to rotate the screw at a speed of 0.0259721614 rotations
per second. NEMA-17 motors typically have 200 steps per revolution,
thus the driver must step the motor at 5.1944 steps per seccond.

The stepper drivers are configured for 16th step microstepping,
which means that in slow speed, pulses at 83.1Hz are needed, and
in fast speed, we attempt to move the motor at 400 steps per second,
i.e.  with a frequence of 6.4kHz.

Frequency computation
---------------------

The tracker hardware this controller was built for has a barn door radius
of 228mm, and uses an M4 screw, with an increment of 0.7mm per turn.
The motor has 200 steps per revolution, and the stepper driver is
wired for 16th-stepping.

The following code can be fed into the bc calculator program to
compute the parameters for the stepper motor:

   barn_door_radius = 228
   increment_per_turn = 0.7
   steps_per_turn = 200
   microsteps = 16
   prescaler_slow = 64
   f_cpu = 1000000

   pi = 4 * a(1)

   angle_per_turn = increment_per_turn / barn_door_radius
   angle_per_second = 2 * pi / 86164
   turns_per_second = angle_per_second / angle_per_turn
   steps_per_second = steps_per_turn * turns_per_second
   microsteps_per_second = microsteps * steps_per_second
   counts_per_second = f_cpu / prescaler_slow
   counts_per_microstep = counts_per_second / microsteps_per_second
